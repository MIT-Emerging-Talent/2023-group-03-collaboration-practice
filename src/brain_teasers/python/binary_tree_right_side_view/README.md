This Python code implements a function to obtain the right side view of a 
binary tree using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. 
The code defines a TreeNode class to represent nodes in the binary tree and 
provides a function named right_side_view to calculate the right side view.

# Structure
The code consists of the following components:

## TreeNode Class:

Represents a node in a binary tree.
Contains a value, a reference to the left child, and a reference to the right child.

## right_side_view Function:

Takes the root of a binary tree as input.
Returns a list of integers representing the values of nodes in the right side view of the tree.
